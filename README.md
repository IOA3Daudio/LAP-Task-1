# Task-1 of the LAP challenge
Jiale Zhao, Dingding Yao, Zelin Qiu, Chengzhong Wang, and Junfeng Li: Normalization of Head-Related Transfer Functions Based on Neural Networks.

## Preprocessing
The floder named `preprocessing` houses the MATLAB code used for preprocessing the HRTFs.

## Network training
The floder named `training` houses the Python code used for training the neural network.
1. run:
   ```
   python train.py
   ```
   to train the proposed model.
2. run:
   ```
   python test.py
   ```
   to test the trained model and save the results in `*.mat`
